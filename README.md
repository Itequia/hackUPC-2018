## Introduction

Here at Itequia we always carry out our meetings next to a whiteboard. We think that having a visual feedback in a meeting helps a lot with transmitting ideas to clients
and coworkers. But often we need to have online meetings with team members that are not in the office. That's why we would love to have a way to create and share
a **whiteboard in real time** with a group of users.

## The challenge

Itequia's challenge can be summarized in a sentence: "Create an app that allow us to share and draw in a whiteboard in real time with a group of users".

## Minimum requirements

- The app must work on any device (PC, tablet and phone).
- It has to be possible to create rooms with a group of people and a whiteboard.
- After entering a room, the user must be able to draw in the whiteboard. The drawing must be shared in real time to the rest of the room members.

## Optional requirements
- Implement an "undo" action that restores the last action taken by the user.
- Implement more drawing tools (eraser, brush types, color fill, text, layers, adding external images, etc.).
- Export whiteboard as image.
- Zooming in/out of the canvas.
- Implement a chat or integrate this app to Slack (inviting channels to whiteboards, exporting whiteboard to channels as images, etc).
- Adding a text/image recognition to recognize and render text and drawings on paper.
- Implement a hardware solution to hook a whiteboard to a TV or projector permanently.
- More features that you find interesting or creative and helps us improve our productivity.

## Evaluation
As we said, your project must solve all the minimum requirements and some of the optional. What we will value the most is the app that better improves our
productivity. Originality and usability should be your top priorities when doing this challenge!

Good luck! Remember that you can always ask our team as many questions as you need. 

Happy hacking!
